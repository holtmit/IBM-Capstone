# IBM-Capstone
This is the Capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. For the project, Seattle Police Department data on vehicular accidents were analyzed and a machine learning algorithm was ran to determine whether weather conditions at the time of the accidents resulted in the likelihood an accident would be more or less severe.
